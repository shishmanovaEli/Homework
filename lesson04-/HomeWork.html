    <p style="text-align: justify; column-count: 4;">
        Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance,
        which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms.
        It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides neither food, energy, nor organic
        micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H<sup>2</sup>O,indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen
        and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an
        angle of 104.45&#x00B0; water" is the name of the liquid state of H<sup>2</sup>O at standard conditions for
        temperature and pressure. A number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in
        the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided,
        crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water
        covers about 70.9&#x0025; of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans. Small portions of water occur
        as groundwater (1.7&#x0025;), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7&#x0025;), and in
        the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation
        (0.001&#x0025;). Water moves continually through the water cycle of
        evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually
        reaching the sea.
