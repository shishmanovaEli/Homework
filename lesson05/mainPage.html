        <img src="Resources/Images/Horse.jpeg">
        <p id="f_horses" style="text-align: justify;">Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive
            markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color,
            before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,
            which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color. Many genes that
            create horse coat colors and patterns
            have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat
            color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of
            chestnut and black are determined by the gene
            controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the "extension gene" or "red factor", as its
            recessive form is "red" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black. Additional genes control suppression
            of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard,
            dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many
            possible coat colors found in horses.

        <h3 style="text-align: center ;">Post #2 Dogs </h3>
        <img src="Resources/Images/Dogs.jpeg">

        <p id="f_dogs" style="text-align: justify;">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
            domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene
            wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be
            domesticated by
            humans. Hunter-gatherers did this, over 15,000 years ago in Germany, which was before the development
            of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
            domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate
            for other canids. The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
            capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many
            roles for
            humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
            companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to
            human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on
            human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

        <h3 style="text-align: center ;">Post #3 Cats </h3>
        <img src="Resources/Images/Cats.jpg">
        <p id="f_cats" style="text-align: justify;">The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat
            or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and
            genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is
            commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
            It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws
            it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
            sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
            solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring,
            trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too
            high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives
            pheromones.
