                    Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb, thus helping
                    end World War 2. We see his life from university days all the way to post-WW2, where his fame saw
                    him embroiled in political machinations. </td>
                <td style="text-align: justify;  padding: 10px;">In Korea, Na Young, a girl and Hae Sung, a boy are
                    school mates and good friends. They often walk back home together after school. Na Young moves to
                    Canada and then to New York with her parents. Hae Sung continues living in Korea, does his
                    engineering course, goes through a short spell of military service and then takes up a job. Both
                    keep in touch periodically through video chats where they talk of their past and general stuff.
                    Meanwhile in New York, Na has changed her name to Nora, made a name as a playwright and is happily
                    married to Arthur, an American. Hae is keen to meet Nora and visits her in New York where he spends
                    some time with her and Arthur. What has the future in store for Nora and Hae in their relationship?

                <td style="text-align: justify;  padding: 10px;"> When oil is discovered in 1920s Oklahoma under Osage
                    Nation land, the Osage people are murdered one by one - until the FBI steps in to unravel the
                    mystery.</td>
                <td style="text-align: justify;  padding: 10px;"> From filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma
                    Stone comes the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman
                    brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe).
                    Under Baxter's protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella
                    runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind
                    adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her
                    purpose to stand for equality and liberation. —Searchlight Pictures</td>
                <td style="text-align: justify;  padding: 10px;">The story begins when Samuel is found dead in the snow
                    outside the isolated chalet where he lived with his wife Sandra, a German writer, and their
                    partially-sighted 11-year-old son Daniel. An investigation leads to a conclusion of "suspicious
                    death": it's impossible to know for sure whether he took his own life or was killed. Sandra is
                    indicted, and we follow her trial which pulls the couple's relationship apart. Daniel is caught in
                    the middle: between the trial and their home life, doubts take their toll on the mother-son
                    relationship. —Cineuropa </td>
